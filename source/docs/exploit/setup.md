# Setup

Download the vpn config file from THM, and use it to configure 

    sudo openvpn --config ./<username>-exploitingad.ovpn --daemon

Check PID (you get a number, if not, doesn't work):

    sudo ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -i <username>-exploitingad.ovpn | awk -v FS=' ' '{print $2}'

Set your DNS IPv4 to the IP address of the THMDC in the network diagram, and run:

    sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

Test:

    nslookup thmdc.za.tryhackme.com

Get your credentials from `http://distributor.za.tryhackme.loc/creds`.

You can now either login with `ssh`, for example:

    $ ssh za.tryhackme.loc\\<AD Username>@thmwrk1.za.tryhackme.loc

Or by RPD:
