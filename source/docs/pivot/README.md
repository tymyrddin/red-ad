# Introduction

## What?

Move around the network while creating as few alerts as possible. From one system taking over another.

## Why?

To have alternatives to find the best path to take. For example, if another system is untouchable or more secure or if the first was 
not compromised.

## How?

* Moving through the network
* Spawning processes remotely
* Moving laterally using wmi
* Use of alternate authentication material
* Abusing user behaviour
* Port forwarding
