# Configuration files

Suppose a breach that gave access to a host on the organisation's network. In that case, configuration files are an 
excellent avenue to explore further for recovering (more) AD credentials. Depending on the host that was breached, 
configuration files may be available for such enumeration: 

* Web application config files
* Service configuration files
* Registry keys
* Centrally deployed applications

Eumeration scripts like Seatbelt can be used to automate this process.
